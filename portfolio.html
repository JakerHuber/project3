          <div class="fluid_details">
            <p>In 2017 I was given the opportunity to build a PC for CompTIA's latest interactive education experiment. An app was in development that would utilize VR to train students with PC Hardware. I was tasked with planning and building a PC that could meet the processing demands while being portable enough to take to conferences.</p>

            <p>Last year I decided that I would build my own personal VPN. I wanted to securely connect to my home network from anywhere. First, I found an old server and switch. Then, I built a server rack out of furniture I bought from IKEA. Next, I downloaded the software I needed from Microsoft Imagine. Finally, I setup the software and configured the virtual network in Azure. Here's a diagram of my point-to-site VPN.</p>
